# resume-studio

resume-studio is an AI-assisted resume optimization platform designed to enhance, not replace, human-written resumes.

Rather than generating resumes entirely from scratch, the system helps users curate, refine, and tailor existing resume content by intelligently selecting strong variants, highlighting gaps, and guiding human improvement where AI alone falls short.

The end goal is a polished resume formatted in Jake’s Resume Template, tailored to specific job descriptions while preserving authenticity, clarity, and human voice.

## 🚀 Philosophy

Many AI resume tools attempt to automate writing entirely. In practice:

- AI-generated sentences often sound generic or overly wordy
- Important nuance and personality can be lost
- Fully automated resumes may lack credibility

**resume-studio takes a collaborative approach:**

> AI supports evaluation, refinement, and tailoring - humans provide the strongest original content.

This preserves authenticity while benefiting from structured AI assistance.
